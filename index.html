					<h1>Spirit</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
					Spirit is a third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game which has not been created yet from a company, but written out of the mastermind Alexander Eriksson (Galnearne). This game is inspired by SMITE, Diablo III.<br>
					In Spirit, players has control over a hero in third-person, using abilities and tactics against other player-controlled heroes. It is based on two teams battle over the kingdoms, with different game-modes. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's towers and barracks, before you get to the "town hall". The battle is a contract named "conquest", a war between kingdoms and their strongest heroes. Each Spirit match is discrete, with all heroes starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game. The heroes is based on fantasy with both angels, demons, humans, fairies and other humanlike creatures.
					The gameplay is inspired by SMITE, but the item build and potions is like Diablo series. You also can't buy a Sword while playing a hero with a Bow.

					Buff and Crowd Controlls: 
					</h3>
					<p>
					A buff is any status effect given to a champion or a minion that gives them a beneficial boost to their performance. The opposite is called a debuff. Buffs can benefit almost any attribute of a hero, such as health, mana, power, defence, movement or attack speed, but may provide more than mere statistical changes in some cases. Most buffs are temporary, but some may be permanent (such as
					<a href="hero.html#tank">

					</a>

					</p><p>
					Debuff, also called Crowd Control is the opposite of buff, that also can remove the control over a hero with charm, fear, flee, taunt, root or stun. I call it Crowd-mind or Crowd-body, because they are abilities that can remove some of the controls that affects the mind or the body.
